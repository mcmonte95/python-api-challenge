# Weather and Vacation Analysis

## Overview
This project utilizes Python scripting to analyze weather data for over 500 cities at varying distances from the equator, leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API and the `citipy` library. The analysis aims to explore the relationship between weather variables and latitude. Additionally, the project uses the Geoapify API and the `geoviews` Python library to plan future vacations based on ideal weather conditions.

## Part 1: WeatherPy

### Objective
To visualize and analyze how weather changes as we approach the equator.

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Generate random geographic coordinates and use `citipy` to find the nearest city for each coordinate set. Retrieve weather data for these cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.

2. **Data Visualization**: Create scatter plots to showcase relationships between latitude and key weather variables:
   - Latitude vs. Temperature
   - Latitude vs. Humidity
   - Latitude vs. Cloudiness
   - Latitude vs. Wind Speed

3. **Linear Regression Analysis**: 
   - Perform linear regression on each relationship.
   - Separate the data into Northern Hemisphere (latitude >= 0) and Southern Hemisphere (latitude < 0).
   - Create scatter plots with regression lines for each hemisphere and weather variable.

### Findings
- Summary of key relationships and trends observed between latitude and weather variables.

## Part 2: VacationPy

### Objective
To use weather data to identify potential vacation destinations and nearby hotels.

### Methodology
1. **Ideal Weather Condition**: Narrow down the cities to those with ideal weather conditions:
   - Max temperature between 21Â°C and 27Â°C.
   - Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s.
   - Zero cloudiness.

2. **Hotel Search**: Use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel within 10,000 meters of each city's coordinates.

3. **Mapping**: 
   - Create a map visualization with a point for every city. Point size represents humidity.
   - Add hotel names and country information in hover tooltips for each city.

### Results
- A DataFrame and an interactive map showing potential vacation destinations and hotels.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of Python and APIs in data gathering, analysis, and visualization, particularly for geographical and meteorological data. The insights drawn from this analysis can be utilized for various applications, including travel planning and climate study.
